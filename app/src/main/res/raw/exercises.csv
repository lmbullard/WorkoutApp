Step 3 : With a handle on each hand, lie on the incline bench and bring your hands together at arms length in front of your face. This will be your starting position. Step 4 : With a slight bend of your elbows (in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon), lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary. The movement should only occur at the shoulder joint. Step 5 : Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and exhale. Hold the contracted position for a second. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights. Step 6 : Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.",chest,Strength,https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/incline-cable-flye

Remember to keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement. Step 3 : Lower the bar back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Step 4 : Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",shoulders,Strength,https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/upright-barbell-row
Barbell full Squat,"Step 1 : This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack just above shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Step 2 : Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step 3 : Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder-width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Step 4 : Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting back with your hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until your hamstrings are on your calves. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Step 5 : Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel or middle of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position. Step 6 : Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",legs,Strength,https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/barbell-full-squat
Front Barbell Squat,"Step 1 : This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control. Step 2 : Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step 3 : Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section). Step 4 : Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly. Step 5 : Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Step 6 : Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",legs,Strength,https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/front-barbell-squat
Snatch,"Step 1 : Place your feet at a shoulder width stance with the barbell resting right above the connection between the toes and the rest of the foot. Step 2 : With a palms facing down grip, bend at the knees and keeping the back flat grab the bar using a wider than shoulder width grip. Bring the hips down and make sure that your body drops as if you were going to sit on a chair. This will be your starting position. Step 3 : Start pushing the floor as if it were a moving platform with your feet and simultaneously start lifting the barbell keeping it close to your legs. Step 4 : As the bar reaches the middle of your thighs, push the floor with your legs and lift your body to a complete extension in an explosive motion. Step 5 : Lift your shoulders back in a shrugging movement as you bring the bar up while lifting your elbows out to the side and keeping them above the bar for as long as possible. Step 6 : Now in a very quick but powerful motion, you have to get your body under the barbell when it has reached a high enough point where it can be controlled and drop while locking your arms and holding the barbell overhead as you assume a squat position. Step 7 : Finalize the movement by rising up out of the squat position to finish the lift. At the end of the lift both feet should be on line and the arms fully extended holding the barbell overhead.",legs,strength,https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/snatch
Dumbbell Lunges,"Step 1 : Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides. This will be your starting position. Step 2 : Step forward with your right leg around 2 feet or so from the foot being left stationary behind and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground. Step 3 : Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale. Step 4 : Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.",legs,strength,https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/dumbbell-lunges
Leg Press,"Step 1 : Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section). Step 2 : Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position. Step 3 : As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle. Step 4 : Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale. Step 5 : Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.",legs,strength,https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/leg-press
